## Testing and coverage

The test suite uses Vitest with React Testing Library. Coverage thresholds are enforced via the Vite test configuration to keep statements, branches, functions, and lines at or above 80%. Run tests locally with:

```
npm run test:coverage
```

The suite includes unit coverage for product management flows, pick list utilities, numeric steppers, autocompletion, and dialog behaviors to ensure core UX remains stable.
